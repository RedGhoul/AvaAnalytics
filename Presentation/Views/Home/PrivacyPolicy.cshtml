    <p>
        No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP
        address, User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory
        for 8 hours at the most to identify a browsing session.
    </p>

    <p>
        The exception to this are requests which are deemed to be coming from a bot,
        in which case the IP address will be stored temporarily for the purpose of
        blocking botnets, hosting providers, and other types of abuse.
    </p>

    <p>There is no information stored in the browser with cookies.</p>
